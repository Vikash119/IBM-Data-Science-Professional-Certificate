#### Add your code below following the instructions given in the course

# Exercise 1: Create a Jupyter Notebook
# Create a new Jupyter notebook called DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb
# Exercise 2: Create markdown cell with title of the notebook
# Create a markdown cell with the title Data Science Tools and Ecosystem using H1 style heading.
# Take a screenshot of the markdown cell and name it as 2-title.png (Images can be saved with either the .jpg or .png extension.)
# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
## In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
__Objective:__
- Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook and how to upload the files on Github.
- Understand the languages that data scienits used
- simple examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
## Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
- Julia
- Python
- R
## Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
## Data Science Tools
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(["Jupyter Notebook", "Rstudio", "Apache Zeppelin"], columns=["Data Science Tools"])
df
### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
(3*4)+5
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
- 
result = 200/60
print('200 mins is about',result,'hours')
